### Graded Lab Activity #7

1. Analyze the cost-effectiveness of competing architectural solution proposals.
   - Test the use of native tools available through cloud providers to manage costs
   - Determine the guidance framework for managing and optimizing costs of cloud solutions
   - Use strategies to track the cost metrics using cloud price calculators
   - Review vendor offerings, services, pricing models, and service level agreements (SLA)

### Introduction:
Cloud provider provides a variety of cloud services in a variety of cloud service models: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. When businesses migrate to the cloud, they must choose which model is best suited to their needs and is the most cost-effective. This course is designed to assist Cloud Architects in identifying their current cloud expenditures and providing greater awareness of the costs associated with each deployment model as well as each aspect of a cloud deployment.  
Optimizing cloud costs begins with knowing your current cloud expenditures. This course introduces you to the tools built into the cloud Portal that can help you understand the total overall expenditures in cloud as well as break down those costs by area: Compute, Network, Storage, Identity, and App/Cloud Services.  
The remainder of the course drills down on specific costs associated with each area of cloud identifies the costs associated with each service and provides very clear and concise methods for reducing cloud expenditures. Many of the cost savings methods will require minimal changes to your cloud deployment and will take just minutes to implement while other cost savings methods may take a shift in your cloud strategy, such as moving from Iaas to PaaS.

### Purpose of the hands-on-lab that can be simulated for any CSP: 
In this lab you will explore azure functionality that would provide insight into performance and configuration of Azure resources, focusing in particular on Azure virtual machines. To accomplish this, you intend to examine the capabilities of Azure Monitor, including Log Analytics.

### Task 4: Trigger an alert and confirm it is working
1. In this task, you trigger the alert and confirm a notification is sent.
2. Note: If you delete the virtual machine before the alert rule deploys, the alert rule might not be triggered.
3. In the portal, search for and select Virtual machines.
4. Check the box for the az104-vm0 virtual machine.
5. Select Delete from the menu bar.
6. Check the box for Apply force delete. Enter delete to confirm and then select Delete.
7. In the title bar, select the Notifications icon and wait until vm0 is successfully deleted.
8. You should receive a notification email that reads, Important notice: Azure Monitor alert VM was deleted was activated... If not, open your email program and look for an email from azure-noreply@microsoft.com.

Conclusion of Lab 6: Cost Management and Monitoring in Azure
In this lab, we explored how Azure Monitor and Log Analytics can provide essential tools for cloud cost management and infrastructure monitoring, helping administrators keep resources in check and prevent unexpected expenses. By configuring alerts, setting up real-time notifications, and running log queries, we gained valuable insights into the workings of virtual machines and resource utilization patterns. The lab emphasized the importance of being proactive with alerts, such as when a VM is accidentally deleted, allowing for immediate response to avoid costly disruptions. Additionally, creating alert processing rules helped reduce alert fatigue during planned maintenance, focusing attention on critical events only. With log-based tracking and insights into resource performance, this lab demonstrated the full range of tools that Azure provides to help businesses gain a clear picture of their cloud costs, optimize infrastructure use, and respond quickly to potential issues.

Real Word Use Case

In a real-world business setting, these tools provide significant value by enhancing operational efficiency, cost control, and security. Real-time alerts and notifications enable administrators to quickly detect and address infrastructure issues, such as unexpected VM deletions or resource spikes, which helps keep operations running smoothly and minimizes unplanned downtime. Additionally, Azureâ€™s monitoring and cost-management tools allow companies to track cloud spending closely. This visibility enables teams to make informed adjustments to resource usage, optimizing performance and reducing wasteful expenses. Furthermore, continuous monitoring and alerting for unusual activities strengthen security and support compliance efforts. These alerts help teams swiftly respond to any irregularities, protecting sensitive data and minimizing the risk of compliance violations. Another significant application of these monitoring tools is improving strategic planning and budgeting. With detailed insights into cloud expenses and resource utilization, businesses can forecast their cloud spending more accurately and develop strategies for cost optimization Azure Monitorâ€™s data on resource usage patterns allows teams to identify high-cost areas and potential inefficiencies, which can then be addressed through scaling adjustments or resource reallocation. This insight aids financial planning and allows companies to allocate their budgets effectively, ensuring they stay within financial goals while maintaining optimal performance.
